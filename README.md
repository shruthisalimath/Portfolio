  ## User Story

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position


## Acceptance Criteria
Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work.

1.WHEN I load their portfolio
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
2.WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
3.WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
   THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
4.WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
   THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
5.WHEN I click on the images of the applications
   THEN I am taken to that deployed application
6.WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
